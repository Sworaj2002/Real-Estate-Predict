# Real-Estate-Predict
Built a machine learning model to predict real estate prices using features like CRIM, ZN, NOX, RM, TAX, etc. Applied data preprocessing, feature selection, and regression techniques using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) to improve prediction accuracy of housing prices (MEDV).
# üè† Real Estate Price Prediction

This project predicts housing prices using machine learning techniques on the Boston Housing dataset. The model uses various features such as crime rate (CRIM), number of rooms (RM), tax rate (TAX), and more to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).

## üìä Features Used

- CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots
- INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
- DIS: Weighted distances to employment centers
- RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: Property-tax rate per \$10,000
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black residents
- LSTAT: % lower status of the population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes (target)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for model building)

## üöÄ Workflow

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection and Correlation Analysis
4. Model Building (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
5. Model Evaluation and Visualization

## üìà Result

The model predicts house prices with good accuracy using regression algorithms and insights from correlation and distribution analysis.

## üìÅ Dataset

- Boston Housing Dataset (available via `sklearn.datasets`)

## üß† Future Improvements

- Try other ML algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit
